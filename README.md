Hello Everyone!	 ðŸ‘‹ 

It's Miron, currently student in my final year in Dresden/Germany and highly interested in *UI/UX design*, *computer science* and *engineering* stuff of all kinds.

When I'm not immerged in some fascinating code problem or creating/admiring a beautiful design I like to go climbing or mountain-unicycling, play violin or the sax, bake rolls, and lots more of fun stuff^^

### Check out some of my projects:

**SQLgarden** -- a fun browser game driven by XAMPP! [Go grow some flowers!](https://github.com/MironFoerster/SQLgarden)

**SCRIBUSextended** -- AI powered handwriting Robot with a sleek Web UI, [work in progress;)](https://github.com/MironFoerster/SCRIBUSextended)


```
Process finished with exit code 42: DestinationError: expected 1 destination, received 3 (design,code,engineering)
Not yet sure exactly where to go...hmmm...well then, just have to find a way to combine all three of them!!!
```
