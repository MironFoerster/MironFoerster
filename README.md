Highly interested in *UI/UX design*, *computer science* and *engineering* stuff of all kinds.

When I'm not busy on some code problem or creating/admiring a flawless design I like to go climbing and make musik.

### Check out some of my projects:

**SQLgarden** -- a browser game driven by XAMPP!? [Go grow some flowers!](https://github.com/MironFoerster/SQLgarden)

**SCRIBUSextended** -- AI-powered handwriting Robot with a sleek Web UI, [work in progress;)](https://github.com/MironFoerster/SCRIBUSextended)
