Hello Everyone!	 ðŸ‘‹ 

It's Miron, currently Student in my final year in Dresden/Germany and highly interested in *UX/UI design*, *computer science* and *engineering* stuff of all kinds.

Want to catch my attention? Well, just show me a beautifully designed website and you get me totally absorbed for hours! Even something as simple as a beatiful font should do the trick;)

When I'm not immerged in some fascinating code problem I like to go climbing or mountain-unicycling, do yoga, play violin or the sax, bake rolls, and lots more of fun stuff^^


### Check out some of my amazing projects:

**SQLgarden** -- a fun browser game driven by XAMPP! [Go grow some flowers!](https://github.com/MironFoerster/SQLgarden)

**SCRIBUSextended** -- AI powered handwriting Robot with a sleek Web UI, [work in progress;)](https://github.com/MironFoerster/SCRIBUSextended)


***Process finished with exit code 49: DestinationError: expected 1 destination, received 3 (design, code, engineering)***

Not yet sure exactly where to go...hmmm...well then, why not simply try all three of them?
