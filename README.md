Hello Everyone!	:bike:

Me in a Sentence: 

I'm Miron, currently Student in my final year in Dresden/Germany and highliy interested in CS and engineering stuff of all kinds. 


When I'm not immerged in some fascinating code problem I like to... go climbing, do yoga, play violin or saxophone, go mountain-unicycling, bake bread, ...to be continued.
